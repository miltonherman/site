_Topple provided us with the tools and platform to create high-fidelity feedback loops that gently forced us into communicating what was working and, more importantly, what was not. In three quarters, we went from being massively in debt, to over a million dollars in revenue as we adopted Topple principles and tooling. In the next five years, you are going to start to see forward-thinking companies emerge with gazelle-like speed from the lumbering, status quo herd, and Topple will be the separating factor._
