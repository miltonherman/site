title: "Early Adopter Program MkII"
---

In February 2019 we launched our first early adopter program. Over the next several months we onboarded, trained, and closely mentored 40 people and 7 managers. During that exercise we validated the benefits of adopting our review and writing workflows. But we also learned that most participants struggled with questions like, “What do I need to write?” That question cuts to the core of teamwork. We all need to write information our team mates need to perform their roles. But in order to understand what that is we need a more concrete understanding of the roles in our organization and how they work together. Topple is building a knowledge base product that works the way you do and helps you model the way you work.

This iteration of the Topple Early Adopter Program works with managers at any level. Together we will build out effective maps of the roles in their orgs. Those maps include roles, and the input and output for each role. We’ll describe inter-organization dependencies and periodic information sharing activities. The time commitment for managers is one 4 hour onboarding and training workshop, one 4-6 hour org mapping session, and 15-30 minute bi-weekly 1:1 meetings. The program no longer includes 1:1 meetings with individual contributors.

Beyond our work with managers the program includes:

1. Introduction to the Document Request.
2. DocOps workflow training for entire teams.
3. “How to provide valuable feedback” training.
4. Mentorship via scheduled virtual office hours and email/Slack/Zoom.
5. Monthly team meetings.

## Team Size Requirements

Where the previous program was designed for large team adoption, this iteration focuses on management. For that reason we can be more flexible with the number of people we bring into the program. There is no minimum team size, though we do think members will get more from the program if they bring their group.

## Expected Term

These practices take time to adopt and evaluate. For that reason we ask that our early adopters commit to a 6 month minimum engagement. There is no commitment beyond the initial 6 month period from a participant’s start date. As long as the program remains available and a member remains in good standing they will be welcome to participate.

## Customer Accountability

A program member’s success and our ability to learn from the program depends on participation. In the interest of our mutual benefit, Topple will track member participation and provide regular encouragement. If a member finds the program burdensome or otherwise fails to meet the expectations of the program, we may part with that member or move them to another program if one is available. Topple will also monitor the program itself and the effectiveness of delivery. In the course of that evaluation we may share feedback or participate in retrospectives to identify issues that could or should have been avoided as well as share in our mutual successes.

## Program Performance Evaluation Methods

Evaluating the program, the products, and adoption will require regular measurement. We value our adopter’s time and will make every effort to minimize any impact to their schedules. Our data gathering methods may include personal interviews, regular prompts for in-person feedback, focus group meetings, short periodic surveys, review feedback analysis, and observation during workflow facilitation. Topple may also gather tooling usage statistics and performance data. That data may include statistics like software performance related counters, timers, error reports, number of uses, usage timestamps, and usage duration.

## Pricing, Billing, Terms and Conditions

We are structuring the program pricing based on a retainer + hourly consulting model. The retainer is based on the minimum expected time providing services to members. We expect to meet with members approximately 3 times per month and perform approximately 15 hours of training and review meetings per quarter. Any hours used purely for assessment or data collection are not billable.

## Next Steps

Contact a Topple founder or employee to join the program. We require an interview with the two participating levels of management to confirm that your team is a good fit for the program. If so, we will send you the necessary agreements and schedule your group for a position with the next available wave. In the weeks before the scheduled start date, we will begin working with your team to target an initial set of business workflows and delivery targets for the program. On the start date your team will understand their concrete goals, the program timeline, and how to succeed. 

We’re excited you’ve taken the time to review our early adopter program plan for 2020. I hope you’ll join us for what comes next!
