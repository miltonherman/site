In February 2019 we launched our first early adopter program. We onboarded, trained, and closely mentored over 40 people. During that exercise we validated the benefits of adopting our review and writing workflows. Customers began writing documents and reading them together in a meeting setting. They were surprised and pleased with the results.

They found that reading documents together revealed hidden communication gaps. That resulting team conversations and meetings were more effective. And people felt better informed about their projects, team, and organization. What surprised us was that members struggled to determine what they should write. It is very difficult to write or understand why you’re writing if you lack clarity of subject and scope. That struggle highlighted a common gap. Team members need to understand what information their teammates need from them. And then write to fulfill those needs. Topple is building a knowledge base that works the way you do. It helps you understand what information your team needs, it helps you write it down, and helps your whole team read and refine it.

This iteration of the Topple Early Adopter Program works with managers at any level. Together we will build out effective maps of your organizations. These maps include roles, and each role’s information input and output. We’ll describe inter-organization interaction and information sharing activities. The time commitment for managers is:

1. One, 4-hour onboarding and training workshop
2. One, 4-6 hour organization mapping session
3. 15-30 minute bi-weekly 1:1 meetings

Beyond our work with managers the program includes:

1. Introduction to the Document Request.
2. Reading, writing, and management workflow training for entire teams.
3. “How to run a review session” training.
4. “How to provide valuable feedback” training.
5. Weekly virtual office hours and email/Slack/Zoom mentorship and support.
6. Monthly team meetings.

## Team Size Requirements

Topple designed the previous program for adoption by large teams. This iteration focuses on management. For this reason we will  be more flexible with the number of people we bring into the program. There is no minimum team size, though we have found members get more from the program when they bring their group.

## Expected Term

This program takes time to adopt and test. For that reason we ask that our early adopters commit to a 6-month engagement. There is no commitment beyond the initial 6-month period from a participant’s start date. As long as the program remains available and a member remains in good standing they will be welcome to take part.

## Customer Accountability

We've learned that member success with the program depends on earnest adoption. Topple tracks member participation to understand how different behavior impacts success. This is for our mutual benefit. It helps us provide better guidance and enhance the program. We may part with a member if they find the program too burdensome, or cannot incorporate the guidance. In that case, we may move that member to another program if one is available.

## Program Performance Evaluation Methods

We measure the program, and our products with interviews, surveys, and focus groups. We value our members’ time and will make every effort to accommodate schedules.

## Pricing and Billing

The program uses a retainer + hourly consulting price model. We base the retainer on the expected time providing services to members. We expect to meet with members 3 times per month. And perform about 15 hours of training or review meetings per quarter. Any assessment or data collection hours are not billable.

## Next Steps
Contact a Topple founder or employee to join the program. We need to interview at least two participating levels of management to confirm that your team is a good fit for the program. If so, we will send you the necessary agreements and schedule your group for onboarding.

We’re excited you’ve taken the time to review our early adopter program plan for 2020. I hope you’ll join us for what comes next!
